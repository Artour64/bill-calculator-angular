# BillTipAndSplitCalculator

A calculator for a restaurant bill and tip, with a split option  
Made with Angular  
Time taken: 6 hours 48 minutes  
Testing was done by using the product and checking that the displayed results are the same as expected.  
This project would have been better if a service was used for passing data and logic.  
[Here](https://github.com/Artour64/bill-calculator-angular-v2) is a repository in which this improvement was made, among others. As such it is advised to refer to it instead of this one.  
For comparison, [here](https://github.com/Artour64/bill-calculator-vanilla) is the same project using only HTML and JavaScript, no libraries or frameworks.
