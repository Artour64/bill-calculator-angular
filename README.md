# BillTipAndSplitCalculator

A calculator for a restaurant bill and tip, with a split option.  
Made with Angular.  
Time taken: 6 hours 48 minutes.  
Testing was done by using the product and checking that the displayed results are the same as expected.  
I liked how components allowed me to make logical partitions in the code and to reuse it.  
My two highlights would be the number-input and result components.  
That being said, I may have been a bit overeager to make partitions, perhaps extracting the input form, tip-input, results-all, and results-per-person components was a bit much.  
This project would have been better if a service was used for passing data and logic.  
[Here](https://github.com/Artour64/bill-calculator-angular-v2) is a repository in which this improvement was made, among others. As such it is advised to refer to it instead of this one.  
For comparison, [here](https://github.com/Artour64/bill-calculator-vanilla) is the same project using only HTML and JavaScript, no libraries or frameworks.
